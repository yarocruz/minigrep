# minigrep

Minigrep is a super simple CLI tool built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) based on the classic command line tool [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) (**g**lobally search a **r**egular **e**xpression and **p**rint). For our purposes our tool will search for a specific string in a file.

This is me following [Chapter 12](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html) of The Rust Book - An IO Project: Building a Command Line Program.
